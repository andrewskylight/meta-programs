                                <p>Meta program is a useful pattern to keep track of: it's one of the most effective models when someone wants to move forward but gets stuck for "unknown" reasons.</p>

                                <p>If you try to keep track of them though in real time, especially when starting out, you'll get overwhelmed very quickly. That's why we had developed this tool to you help you harness the full power of the patterns, without being overwhelmed</p>

                                <h2 class="text-success">What to love about meta programs</h2>
	
	<p>The model is flexible, easy to use, and has enough room for personal creativity.</p>
		
		<h3 class="text-muted">Everybody has adequate perception skills right off the bat.</h3>
	
		<p>Let's be honest. A strategy flies by you in a split second. Vocal analog marking can be outside of someone's perception. Eliciting someone's submodality without overtly asking for it is something that master pracs are entertaining themselves with.</p>
	
		<p>Meta-programs on the other hand, are much easier to track and use. You don't have to be watching the other person like a hawk. In fact, you can go home, and reflect on a meeting that could have gone better, using meta-program analysis. And when you think about "what are you going to do differently next time?" - ideas will start to pop into your mind.</p>
	
		<h3 class="text-muted">Meta-programs work in aggregates</h3>
	
		<p>Probably, this is the only model that allows to work with segments and process patterns on a higher scale. For example, let's say I'm selling an online training course. After talking to a number of potential buyers, I can safely conclude: Aha! "this particular group is searching for how to make a difference in the world using proven methods ..." and go from there. </p>
	
		<p>Of course, each person is an individual, and they do have their own belief system, modality preferences, and strategies; but trying to accommodate all the variations they produce with one method ... is simply impractical.</p>
		
		<p>So when you feel a bit overwhelmed by the incoming number of clues? Meta-programs to the rescue.</p>
	
	<h3 class="text-muted">Meta-programs use native language; <small>they don't introduce technical jargon</small></h3>
	
		<p>Sameness, difference, towards, away, internal, and external - simple everyday words. There are no special words like  representational systems, anchors, TOTE, accessing cues, complex equivalences, dovetails, etc. Just start paying attention to words that essentially mean "same" or "different" in someone's communication, and you're done. And by the way, if you miss a few, there is no big deal. Absolutely, no big deal at all.</p>
	
	<h2 class="text-danger">What to avoid</h2>
		<p>Since we talked about what to love, we must then discuss what to avoid. After all not every belief will stand the test of time. These are some of the things that when you encounter them, you might want to go: "oh, old stuff" and walk around it as if it was a pot hole.</p>
	
		<h3 class="text-muted">Don't use personality type statements or conclusions; <small>use process-oriented words and sentences</small></h3>
			<p>The original research group has believed that meta-programs were a structure of personality. They don't believe so anymore, by the way. And making personality like statements: "someone is a mis-matcher" is limiting, and in some cases conflicting.</p>
			
			<p>Now, we have not covered all the necessary tools at the moment to give you a complete example, but consider this: Michael Jordan, one of the best basketball players in his sport, had the following pattern:</p>
			
			<p>Every day before the game he would go out and have his <em>favourite</em> (i.e. same) meal. He would also wear the same lucky shorts from college underneath his official uniform. On the court, though, his mojo was "be unpredictable". Defense expects him to shoot, he passes. You can expect to go right, he goes backwards.</p>
	
			<p>Now is he a <em>"matcher"</em> or a <em>"mis-matcher"</em>? <strong>Or flexibility is the key!</strong></p>
		
	 	<h3 class="text-muted">Avoid system overload</h3>
			<p>The principle is simple. If there is too much information, put some of it aside. Decide what's most useful for you at this time, and label everything else "for later".</p>
			<p>You can always go back to it, when you had mastered the most useful.</p>
	
			<p>Since the model allows for creative input, I personally have a criteria to test something for being a meta-program.</p>
	
			<p>Now there are few more points worth knowing about, but we will save them for dessert.</p>
	
	<h2 class="text-info">Meta-program origins</h2>
		<p>The model was created to account for the following phenomena.</p>
		<p>Given the same: </p>
			<ul>
				<li>set of inputs (for example, one blue ball, and two green balls)</li>
				<li>decision making strategy (compare balls to one another -> get a feeling -> choose)</li>
			</ul>
		<p><em>How come</em> there is a variation in the output (people choose different balls, some people choose green, some blue)?</p>
		<p>So there must be something else which produces variation.</p>
		<p>This is how meta-programs originated. Now I will intentionally skip the original definition, because I don't find it to be useful compared to the criteria and structure.</p>
		
		<img 
			 	src = "structure.jpeg"
			 	class = "img-responsive center-block"
				alt = "structure"
 		>
	<h2 class="text-info">Meta-program structure</h2>
		<p>In the example above, some people chose a blue ball, because it was different from the other two, and other people chose a green one, because it was the same as another one. Some people's attention went to what was different, others to what was the same.</p>
		<h3>At the base of a meta-program you have a pattern, <small>most commonly it will have two polarities to it.</small></h3>
			<p>The pattern is going to be detectable in:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>verbal language, and</li>
						<li>body language.</li>
						<li>submodality distinctions.</li>
					</ul>
	
			<aside class="bs-callout bs-callout-info">
				<p>Note 1: if "submodality distinctions" is an unfamiliar term, just label it with curiosity.</p>
	
				<p>Note 2: some patterns do not have obvious duality structure. I refer to them as sorting principles, for example "people, places, things". For the purpose of clarity I put those patterns in a different category.</p>
			</aside>
	
			<p>To make things more practical and less abstract, lets explore one of the most useful pattern to keep track of: <em>away/towards</em>:</p>
	
		<h2 class="text-info">Away/Towards Meta-Program</h2>
					<div class="row row-buffer">
						<div class="col-xs-3 col-sm-3 col-md-3 col-lg-3 text-right">Away</div>
						<div class="col-xs-6 col-sm-6 col-md-6 col-lg-6"><input class ="form-control" type="range"/></div>
						<div class="col-xs-3 col-sm-3 col-md-3 col-lg-3">Towards</div>
					</div>
				<p>The pattern exists on a spectrum. There are many values in between (you can play with above range element). Now for educational purposes were are going to talk about extremes.</p>
			
			<h3>Elicitation</h3>
				<p>My favourite way to elicit a meta-program is to simply listen and watch for it. What happens with practice, is that you don't really pay attention to it consciously at all times, instead you have a feeling that something is 'off'. And your attention goes directly to a pattern that is causing the stall.</p>
	
				<p>To develop such kinesthetic intuition one must first practise consciously (i.e. with intent and awareness) pay attention to the following clues in the body language and words.</p>
				
				<h4>Body Language</h4>
	
				<p>A moving away response is quite easy to spot: a person will lean back with their body or head, and maybe exhibit a congruent hang gesture. A moving towards response will be expressed with a straight or leaning forward body language, head nods, etc.</p>
	
					<div class="row row-buffer">
						<div class="col-xs-12 col-sm-2"><em>Body Language</em></div>
						<div class="col-xs-12 col-sm-5">A: leaning Away</div>
						<div class="col-xs-12 col-sm-5">T: leaning Towards</div>
					</div>
	
				<h4>Words</h4>
	
				<p>A moving away response is characterized by exclusive language. For example, if you ask someone "what do you want?". They are going to reply "I <em>don't</em> want ...". Now pay attention ... you asked them "what do you <em>want?</em>". The correct response to this question should have a structure "I <em>want</em> ...", yet they are giving you a structure "I <em>don't</em> want ...".</p>
	
				<p>Now you could respond to this "Good. What is it that you want <em>instead</em>?" ... and observe.</p>
						
				<aside><p>I found that if a student has a hard time providing <em>"I want" structure</em> to a "what do you want" question even after a detailed explanation is given, it is an indicator of a lack of flexibility of the 'towards' side of a meta-program. The inverse of that is also true.</p></aside>
				
				<p>A moving towards response is characterized by inclusive language. You will hear a lot "I want ...", also the conversation will be about goals, benefits, and desires.</p>

					<div class="row row-buffer">
						<div class="col-xs-12 col-sm-2"><em>Words</em></div>
						<div class="col-xs-12 col-sm-5">A: exclusive language. For example, "I <em>don't want</em>"</div>
						<div class="col-xs-12 col-sm-5">T: inclusive language. For example, "I <em>want</em> to be able to ..."</div>
					</div>
	
				<h4>Direct Elicitation</h4>
					<p>A classic direct elicitation question is about money. You can ask something like "What is important to you about money? What will money give you?" ... then listen and watch for a response.</p>
					
					<p>When people talk about "freedom, security, comfort, options" that is a generally moving towards response, and this is where the focus for them is.</p>
	
					<p>Conversely, words like "no limitations, avoid poverty, etc" will indicate a moving away response.</p>
			
					<aside>
						<p>Note: Direct elicitation presupposes that you have a "cooperation" scenario. This includes: doing an exercise with a friend, interviewing a prospective employee, having developed strong rapport, etc.</p>
					</aside>
	
			<h3>Applications</h3>
			
			<p>You can do a lot by simply paying attention and adjusting your behaviour. Below you will also find some of the common pointers that have been accumulated over the years in various applications.</p>
			
			<aside>Note: Each scenario below presupposes a win/win outcome.</aside>
			
			<h4>Getting Started</h4>
					
			<p>In a coaching/project setting there is a common milestone where you need to transition a project or a goal from <em>planning</em> to <em>in development</em> state.</p>
			
			<p>I find that giving "something bigger to move away from" to people producing the 'move away' response usually does the trick. You will know that this is something that has to be done, once you had covered:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>goals/outcomes</li>
				<li>benefits</li>
				<li>milestones</li>
				<li>first step</li>
			</ul>
			
			<p>A discussion of "negative consequences" or "sticks" will do next to nothing for people with a 'moving towards' response. Instead, a clearly defined first step (in addition to the usual items) will get the process going.</p>
			
			<div class="row row-buffer">
				<div class="col-xs-12 col-sm-2"><em>Getting started</em></div>
  			<div class="col-xs-12 col-sm-5">A: give them something bigger to move away from</div>
				<div class="col-xs-12 col-sm-5">T: clearly define a first step</div>
			</div>
			
			<h4>Sustaining Motivation</h4>
			<p>Your team/client may "run out of gas" before a project is completed or a goal is achieved.</p>
			<p>Sometimes for people with a 'moving away' response, the negative consequences of not finishing may become faded (less intense) as time goes by (after all "it's so far away"). Briefly revisit "something bigger to move away from" and we are on our way :) </p>
			
			<aside>If I figured out that's the case, I note down the amount of time elapsed between then and now, and schedule a "five minute" refresher for the future (<em>proactive / reactive</em> meta-program > proactive response).</aside>
			
			<p>Sometimes people with 'moving towards' responses, will stall before completion if the next goal and it's first step are not well defined. Be sure to cover that ground, if required.</p>
			
	
			<div class="row row-buffer">
				<div class="col-xs-12 col-sm-2"><em>Continuous Motivation</em></div>
  			<div class="col-xs-12 col-sm-5">A: away from consequences may become less compelling with time</div>
				<div class="col-xs-12 col-sm-5">T: may require the next goal be defined before current project is finished</div>
			</div>
			
			<h4>Business Applications</h4>
			<p>Meta-programs have a wide range of business applications. They cover everything from hiring the right people and putting them into the right places to switching a business owner's meta-programs in relationship to business/project life cycle.</p>
			
			<p>For example, people who frequent the moving away response will be very happy in: cutting costs, reducing overhead, and reducing downtime. These people will also make great safety managers.</p>
						
			<p>Harsh disciplinary measures will not work with people who favour the 'towards' response.</p>
			
			<aside><p>The towards/away meta-program will also predict a lack of rapport or cooperation between an 'away' oriented safety manager, and an a 'goal/towards' oriented business owner.</p></aside>
	
			<div class="row row-buffer">
				<div class="col-xs-12 col-sm-2"><em>Business Applications</em></div>
  			<div class="col-xs-12 col-sm-5">A: interested in cutting costs, reducing overhead/downtown</div>
				<div class="col-xs-12 col-sm-5">T: harsh disciplinary measures won't work</div>
			</div>
			
			<h4>Sales/Persuasion Applications</h4>
			<aside>Keeping a win/win scenario in mind...</aside>
			
			<p>You many encounter a point in the sales process when all of a sudden the client starts to 'move away'.</p>
			
			<p>For example, I'm on the phone with someone and they are asking about an online course, things are going well and my course satisfies their buying criteria. Then they ask me about payment methods (I accept payments online) and the process comes to a grinding halt (they are afraid and start <em>'moving away'</em>). My typical response to this is "you don't have to buy, if you don't feel comfortable." (just a <em>gentle 'push away'</em>) Then I wait for their response. It will typically indicate that they are now ready for the dialogue to continue, so I follow-up with a description of high security standards implemented and how their data is protected.</p>
			
			<p>At some point I was asked to "sell" safety to business owners by a reputable insurance company (they enjoyed 80% of the commercial insurance market share). The key term of the sales pitch was <em>reduce high cost claims</em> (<em>'away' polarity</em>). A simple reframing of <em>capitalize on high cost opportunities</em>, <em>beat competition in insurance costs</em>, <em>open more doors for businesses with an impeccable safety record</em> attracted a lot more stake-holders on board.</p>
			
			<div class="row row-buffer">
				<div class="col-xs-12 col-sm-2"><em>Sales Applications</em></div>
  			<div class="col-xs-12 col-sm-5">A: may need a gentle push away</div>
				<div class="col-xs-12 col-sm-5">T: require benefits before moving to a decision point</div>
			</div>

	<h3>Full side of the spectrum</h3>
	<p>Now, we talked about extremes because it makes sense in learning environment. In practise, the odds of encoutering a "purely moving away" or "purely moving towards" person is about 5%. Most of the people "sit" somewhere in between. It is a common practise to label some responses as <em>Towards/Away</em> or <em>Away/Towards</em>. In a nutshell, it shows that a towards/away person will prefer to consider benefits first, and consequences second. It also comments on how much time a person will want to spend focusing on each side.</p>
